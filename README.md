# WAIT!

This is official WAIT! company website source code.  
We produce accessories from recycled awnings, a durable, unpretentious and water-repellent material that is used in freight transportation and construction. The fittings we use are widely used in the tourism and military industries around the world. So our bags turned out to be reliable and functional, which makes them an excellent companion in the city and beyond.
