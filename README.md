# WAIT!
This is official WAIT! company website source code.  
We produce accessories from recycled awnings, a durable, unpretentious and water-repellent material that is used in freight transportation and construction. The fittings we use are widely used in the tourism and military industries around the world. So our bags turned out to be reliable and functional, which makes them an excellent companion in the city and beyond. 

## wait-web
It is a small app written on Python with Django framework for commercial purposes. In WAIT! we sure that transparency in web commercial should be a common thing, so we released our code in public. We are not collecting any unnecessary user data and everyone now can check it.
